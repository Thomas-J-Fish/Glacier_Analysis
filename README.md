.png files are the finalised figures for use in the paper
.ipynb files are the cleaning and analysis files to develop the figures
.csv and .xlsx are the raw data files used for the analysis
Note: The preliminary_analysis.ipynb is for correlation discovery, not all the analysis in that file was completed and much was left unfixed and messy.
